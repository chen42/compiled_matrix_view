# Detecting Structural variants from matrix view images

### Layout of the images.
||||
|---|---|---|
|BNSanger | BNSon | BNEve | BN-Lx|
|BXH10 | HXB15 | HXB25 |SHR-Ola|

### Large tandem duplication in SHR, BXH10, HXB15 but no tin HXB25

---
### Relatively small deletion in BXH10, HXB15, and SHR
![](images/loc_chr10_100910000-101970000.png)
---
### Duplication and deletion in SHR and HXB25
* also note BN has het deletions, several of them become homozygotic in SHR and enlarged.

### Deletions in BXH10 and SHR

---
### A novel deletion in HXB25

---
### Tandem duplication in BXH10 and SHR

---
### Tandem duplication in BXH10 and SHR

---
### Deletions in BXH10 and SHR
![](images/loc_chr11_85290000-85610000.png)
---
### Deletion in BXH10 HXB25 and SHR
![](images/loc_chr12_11530000-11960000.png)
---
### Duplication in BXH10 HXB25 and SHR
![](images/loc_chr12_17099931-17336368.png)
---
### Complicated, maybe:  
* a duplication in SHR BXH10 and HXB25
* a tandem duplication in SHR, BXH10 and HXB25

### Deletions 
![](images/loc_chr12_17760000-18100000.png)
---
### Several of them: 
* Heterozygotic deletions in BN becomes homozygotic in SHR
* SHR also has two new deletions, which are inherited in BXH10 and HXB25.
* Another duplication in SHR, BXH10 and HXB25 (lower left corner)

### There is an assembly error, but also a true SV at the same location in SHR, BXH10 and HXB25
![](images/loc_chr12_18520000-18960000.png)
---
### Small het deletion in BN enlarged and become homozygotic in SHR and BXH10
![](images/loc_chr12_2187910-2422279.png)

### this is called as a DEL in longranger.
